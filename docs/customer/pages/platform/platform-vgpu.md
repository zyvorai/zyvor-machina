# vGPU Partitions

## Purpose

vGPU Partitions — split a GPU into mediated-device partitions, give each to a VM, and see which VMs are pinned to a host by one. Page at `/platform/vgpu`.

## When to use it

- Open this page when the job matches the purpose above
- Use Mission Control (`/platform`) for fleet-wide work; use Core routes for this host only
- Confirm PAM/OIDC login and roles if actions are missing

## How to get there

- Route: `/platform/vgpu`
- Nav: **Platform → vGPU Partitions** (or spotlight / Finder search)

## What you can do

1. Open `/platform/vgpu` against the Machina daemon (`https://<host>:5092`).
2. Use filters and host/VM selectors when the page provides them.
3. Drill into a VM, host, or Fleet Cloud resource for consoles and detail panels.
4. For mutating actions (create/delete VM, apply firewall, Fleet Cloud change): confirm the target host and role (Admin/Operator).

If the page stays empty, check daemon health (`/api/v1/health`), libvirt connectivity, and whether the feature requires Fleet Cloud or Launchpad to be enabled.
